Media neglect to cover accomplishments of the Trump administration; reaction from Sean Spicer, Tammy Bruce and Joe Concha on 'Hannity.'), Block(571124289-3,Hannity-571124289,,3,
This is a rush transcript from "Hannity," March 23, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.), Block(571124289-4,Hannity-571124289,SEAN HANNITY, HOST,4,
 Welcome to special edition of "Hannity."), Block(571124289-5,Hannity-571124289,SEAN HANNITY, HOST,5,
Crisis in America: media double standard.), Block(571124289-6,Hannity-571124289,SEAN HANNITY, HOST,6,
Now, tonight, we will expose how journalism in America is absolutely dead. News and facts just no longer matter. They are now being replaced by endless cycle of fake news, liberal propaganda and lies. And right now, there is no separation between what is supposed to be an unbiased press and the Democratic Party. They are one in the same.), Block(571124289-7,Hannity-571124289,SEAN HANNITY, HOST,7,
Now, the perfect example comes from liberal fake news, CNN. The professional Trump haters that found a new fix. It's their new sick and twisted obsession and here's a hint. It has nothing to do with Russia.), Block(571124289-8,Hannity-571124289,SEAN HANNITY, HOST,8,
Also coming up tonight, after a year plus of rampant speculation and out- of-control conspiracy theory, the media still cannot find any evidence of Trump-Russia collusion and they won't stop.), Block(571124289-9,Hannity-571124289,SEAN HANNITY, HOST,9,
And also, new exclusive reporting tonight from The Hill, the Uranium One's FBI informant speaks out right here tonight about Clinton corruption and the disastrous Uranium One deal, the media has been ignoring it, something you will only see on "Hannity."), Block(571124289-10,Hannity-571124289,SEAN HANNITY, HOST,10,
All of that 
ing news tonight, plus the press is launching blistering attacks against President Trump's new national security advisor John Bolton and also tonight a quick commentary. I have some words for the Republicans in Congress because they have a fuming -- they can't keep their word and they stand for nothing and they have betrayed the people that voted for them.), Block(571124289-11,Hannity-571124289,SEAN HANNITY, HOST,11,

 All right. We start tonight with the big 
ing developments. The chief of fake news CNN soon to be scandal plague Jeff Zucker, he has a new obsession and here's what we mean. Profanity laced 24/7 coverage that would make a sailor blush is no longer enough for Jeff Zucker and his liberal fake news cohorts.), Block(571124289-14,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,14,
Well, the bleep-hole network is now looking for new ways to outdo despicable coverage of today. Now, you may remember some of this.), Block(571124289-15,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,15,

 Now, part of that is funny but it's also really sad.), Block(571124289-36,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,36,
According to the Media Research Center, fake news CNN, they dropped bleep- hole 195 times in one day during their round the clock bleep-hole obsessed coverage. But now that depravity, that's not good enough. So, Jeff Zucker is now trying a new tactic to hold up ever sinking and shrinking audience.), Block(571124289-37,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,37,
Take a look. The so-called facts first network has a new fixation. It's like soft core porn. That's right, this is CNN.), Block(571124289-38,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,38,
Well, after the pathetic Trump collusion conspiracy blew up in their faces, CNN is going absolutely wild wall-to-wall speculation about a consensual relationship between the president going back 12 years or so ago with a former porn star or current porn star Stormy Daniels. It's Stormy 24/7.), Block(571124289-39,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,39,
Now, take a look at what CNN now considers journalism.), Block(571124289-40,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,40,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-41,Hannity-571124289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,41,
 Stormy Daniels, I know have you heard a ton about that and we have to see where that case goes and what this interview is about.), Block(571124289-42,Hannity-571124289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,42,
 Is that possible to come up in the Stormy Daniels lawsuit? Will she be able to say hey, look, this lawyer is involved with a whole bunch of different things here?), Block(571124289-43,Hannity-571124289,UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE,43,

 The reason he can't engage with Stormy Daniels is because she's got his number.), Block(571124289-64,Hannity-571124289,UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE,64,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-65,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,65,
 And even a porn star can't satisfy Jeff Zucker's. Anderson Cooper tracked down Karen McDougal, former Playboy playmate while she is alleging that she had a consensual relationship with Donald Trump over a decade ago.), Block(571124289-66,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,66,
But pay close attention to Anderson Cooper's kind of creepy questions during this interview. Take a listen.), Block(571124289-67,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,67,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-68,Hannity-571124289,ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST,68,
 Worked for playboy for some time. You could see him looking at you. We call you?), Block(571124289-69,Hannity-571124289,KAREN MCDOUGAL, FORMER PLAYBOY PLAYMATE,69,
 He would call me. I would call him, vice versa.), Block(571124289-70,Hannity-571124289,COOPER,70,
 So, you had his phone number. When he called, did his number show up in the phone? Were you attracted to him? So the sex was consensual?), Block(571124289-71,Hannity-571124289,COOPER,71,
You said you should have ended on a strange note. So, what happened after you had been intimate?), Block(571124289-72,Hannity-571124289,COOPER,72,
Did he actually try to hand you money? Did he ever compare you to any of his kids?), Block(571124289-73,Hannity-571124289,COOPER,73,
This is a hard question to ask and but you said had you sex that first time. All these times you saw him, this was an ongoing sexual relationship?), Block(571124289-74,Hannity-571124289,MCDOUGAL,74,
 Absolutely.), Block(571124289-75,Hannity-571124289,COOPER,75,
 Can you estimate how many times you actually saw him? You were intimate?), Block(571124289-76,Hannity-571124289,MCDOUGAL,76,
 Yes.), Block(571124289-77,Hannity-571124289,COOPER,77,
 Many dozens of times.), Block(571124289-78,Hannity-571124289,MCDOUGAL,78,
 Uh-huh.), Block(571124289-79,Hannity-571124289,COOPER,79,
 This is another tough question. And, again, you don't have to answer it but it's been raised with other people. Did he ever use protection?), Block(571124289-80,Hannity-571124289,COOPER,80,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-81,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,81,
 This went on two hours. An alleged consensual relationship. Oh, and she voted for Donald Trump.), Block(571124289-82,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,82,
Jeff Zucker, is this what you consider journalism from your top so-called news anchor? Are you really proud of this?), Block(571124289-83,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,83,
We could only assume that you are because that is all your fake news network has now been covering for about two straight weeks and fake news CNN are not alone. The entire liberal mainstream media has been salivating over this every single day and every detail. And, of course, this isn't even the case. Remember when it came to Bill Clinton's accusers? Very different stories.), Block(571124289-84,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,84,
For decades, the mainstream media has either completely ignored or barely covered the stories of Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey.), Block(571124289-85,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,85,
In fact, take a look at how Clinton sycophant Andrea Mitchell tried to smear and discredit Juanita Broaddrick during the 2016 election in reaction to an interview we did with then candidate Donald Trump. Take a look.), Block(571124289-86,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,86,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-87,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,87,
 It's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.), Block(571124289-88,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,88,
DONALD TRUMP, THEN-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And rape.), Block(571124289-89,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,89,
 And rape.), Block(571124289-90,Hannity-571124289,ANDREA MITCHELL, NBC NEWS CORRESPNDENT,90,
 Donald Trump using that word unprompted during an interview last night with FOX News' Sean Hannity, bringing up a discredited and long denied accusation against former President Bill Clinton, dating back to 1978 when he was Arkansas attorney general.), Block(571124289-91,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,91,
 Andrea just disgraceful. And what is even worse is NBC edited their online version of that clip and removed Andrea Mitchell using the word discredited.), Block(571124289-92,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,92,
And by the way, take a look at some of these numbers from the Media Research Center. 1994, remember Paula Jones, she came forward with details about Bill Clinton sexually harassing her and exposing himself to her she didn't know him. Now, CBS, NBC, they totally ignored the story. ABC gave it a whopping 16 seconds of coverage.), Block(571124289-93,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,93,
And then in 1997 when Paula Jones legal team subpoenaed Kathleen Willey, well, CBS and NBC, they gave it a paltry 34 seconds of coverage. ABC, well, they didn't bother to even do the story. And that same day, CNN, their evening newscast, whopping 26 seconds on the story.), Block(571124289-94,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,94,
1998 when news broke about Juanita Broaddrick accusing Bill Clinton of raping her, ABC, CBS, they didn't care. NBC did spend seven minutes covering the story as they should have.), Block(571124289-95,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,95,
This is all shameful and proves just how abusively biased, hypocritical the media in this country is. The Media Research Center, they search their archives and they found these examples of the liberal press attacking Paula Jones. Remember, she won her lawsuit against Bill Clinton.), Block(571124289-96,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,96,
Take a look.), Block(571124289-97,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,97,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-98,Hannity-571124289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,98,
 If the case is fomented by right wing nuts and yes, she's not a very credible witness and it's really not a law case at all. I think she is a dubious witness. I really do.), Block(571124289-99,Hannity-571124289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,99,
 We've got an awful lot to talk about this week, including the sexual harassment suit against the president. It's tough to figure out who is being harassed.), Block(571124289-100,Hannity-571124289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,100,
 Is she not trying to capitalize on this, in effect to profit from impugning the president?), Block(571124289-101,Hannity-571124289,UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE,101,
 I have to profess complete confusion over this entire case, why this is even a case.), Block(571124289-102,Hannity-571124289,UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE,102,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-103,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,103,
 Now, the media covering for Bill Clinton gets even worse in January of '99. NBC News reporter Lisa Myers, she taped the first exclusive interview with Juanita Broaddrick. I have the second interview with Juanita Broaddrick.), Block(571124289-104,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,104,
Back then, Washington Post, they reported that instead of airing that interview right away, NBC News president Andy Lack, other top executives, sat on that interview for over a month. At the time, NBC News claimed that they could not corroborate Broaddrick's accusation, so the interview did not air until February.), Block(571124289-105,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,105,
Now, while all of this was going on and NBC was trying to bury the story, our colleague here at the Fox News Channel, Brit Hume and his panelists right here, they actually wore free Lisa Myers buttons on air to encourage NBC to run this interview. Well, since they were sitting, of course, on a major news story.), Block(571124289-106,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,106,
Now, that shows you just how far all these liberal networks will go to protect the Clintons. They have now been doing it for decades.), Block(571124289-107,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,107,
Now, let's compare that to all the coverage CNN is now devoting to Stormy Daniels and this former Playboy bunny. Take a look at the chart, Media Research Center, March 7th alone, CNN spent 149 minutes obsessing over Stormy between 5:00 p.m. and midnight. That's just a couple weeks ago.), Block(571124289-108,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,108,
The hypocrisy is beyond stunning. The liberal media doesn't want to listen to what any of Bill Clinton's accusers have to say? Well, they don't want to even know that Bill Clinton confronted Paula Jones in a hotel room and put his pants down and exposed himself? That's not consensual.), Block(571124289-109,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,109,
And on the other hand, we actually have care about the truth on these programs. We think these women should have been heard.), Block(571124289-110,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,110,
Here is what Paula Jones told me. Take a look.), Block(571124289-111,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,111,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-112,Hannity-571124289,PAULA JONES, BILL CLINTON ACCUSER,112,
 We did some small talk and then he started kind of getting a little comfortable and trying to -- he said that he loved the way my hair flowed down my back of my clothes and he liked my perms. He leaned up and pulled me up towards him and was going to try to kiss on me.), Block(571124289-113,Hannity-571124289,PAULA JONES, BILL CLINTON ACCUSER,113,
And so, then I tried to distract him again. I was trying -- I thought what am I doing? My mind is racing.), Block(571124289-114,Hannity-571124289,PAULA JONES, BILL CLINTON ACCUSER,114,
I said, well, I may need to be going. Next thing I know, he pulled down his -- he sit down, pulled down his pants, his whole, everything. And he was exposed and I said I'm not that kind of girl. And I need to be getting back to my desk.), Block(571124289-115,Hannity-571124289,PAULA JONES, BILL CLINTON ACCUSER,115,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-116,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,116,
 In the era of me too, that's not consensual.), Block(571124289-117,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,117,
Here is another thing the media won't tell you about Paula Jones. Bill Clinton, he lost, he ended up paying over $850,000 in a court settlement, out-of-court settlement, that scandal also resulted in five year suspension of Bill Clinton's law license and he was impeached.), Block(571124289-118,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,118,
Then there is Kathleen Willey. She says that in the Oval Office, Bill Clinton groped and grabbed and fondled and kissed Kathleen Willey against her will. Here's how she described it to me as well, take a look.), Block(571124289-119,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,119,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-120,Hannity-571124289,KATHLEEN WILLEY, BILL CLINTON ACCUSER,120,
 No woman should be subjected to it. It was an assault.), Block(571124289-121,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,121,
 He assaulted you?), Block(571124289-122,Hannity-571124289,WILLEY,122,
 Yes.), Block(571124289-123,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,123,
 He touched, grabbed, fondled and touched you and kissed you against your will.), Block(571124289-124,Hannity-571124289,WILLEY,124,
 Yes.), Block(571124289-125,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,125,

 And then there is Juanita Broaddrick. She accused Bill Clinton of raping her in hotel room back in 1978. This was one of the hardest interviews I ever did. Take look.), Block(571124289-129,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,129,

Republicans once again abandoning their core principles, their promises and really, if you voted for many of them, have completely betrayed you, the American people. Now, GOP lawmakers, they got taken to the woodshed by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Instead of showing spine, backbone, vision, and principles, Republicans folded like cheap lawn chairs and then as soon as the budget passed, well, they fled Washington and President Trump was left with no choice to sign this bill because it was either that or get blamed for government shut down or desperately not get the money he needs to rebuild our military which was dilapidated under President Obama.), Block(571124289-139,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,139,
Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, well, they were laughing at these weak and timid Republicans. Now, Republicans should be ashamed of themselves. At this point, can any of them explain what exactly they stand for? Right now, there is a huge distinction between President Trump and the party that is supposed to have his back.), Block(571124289-140,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,140,
Look at the Heritage Foundation report recently: 64 percent of President Trump's agenda has been completed, faster than Ronald Reagan's 49 percent in a year, which is pretty amazing because president Trump has had little to no help from the GOP.

It's why CNN is losing to things like "Naked and Afraid" and reruns of "Friends", because, in fact, facts do matter. People do want information.

Forty-four minutes went to all other news going on in the country and the world. So, I looked it up. What were A.P.'s biggest stories on March 7th? And it's pretty telling.

What that means it translates they're going to keep throwing the kitchen sink at him no matter what on these other networks because they don't know what to do.

 And, Gregg, let's go to this here they thought every step of the way -- they were certain in the media. They were certain that Trump was guilty of collusion. The interesting thing is when I keep playing Obama, just before the election telling Donald Trump lecturing him to stop whining and that, you know, no serious person could ever think that our elections could be in any way influenced by anybody.

 The media's frustration and disappointment in their failure to find collusion is really quite palpable.

 And then, of course, zero mainstream media coverage. Joining us now with more is one of the reporters who interviewed Campbell. Now the Hill's Alison Spann is with us. Thank you for being with us.), Block(571124289-235,Hannity-571124289,ALISON SPANN, REPORTER, THE HILL,235,
 Thanks, Sean.), Block(571124289-236,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,236,
 Thanks for sharing this tape. It's never been seen before. It's never spoken before publicly. I'm listening to this, he knows what's happening in 2009, he infiltrated Putin's operatives in America that had a goal get into America's uranium market. And they're involved in bribery, kickbacks, money laundering and all sorts of extortion.), Block(571124289-237,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,237,
The country knew it, FBI knew it and they still allowed the deal to happen 18 months later and he's talking about how weak our country is. Why did they let this happen?), Block(571124289-238,Hannity-571124289,SPANN,238,
 You know, Sean, it's unclear, but as far as Doug says, he was under cover for six years inside ROSATOM as an FBI informant. He gathered a ton of information. You heard him talk about the scenario where he had the camera inside his suitcase. He caught some Russian officials on camera taking $50,000 in cash. And he presented all of this information to the FBI and they assured him, you know, this information is so good it's gone to the FBI director and it's even gone to the president.), Block(571124289-239,Hannity-571124289,SPANN,239,
President Obama has seen this information. So he was thinking I got this great information. Surely this is going to prevent the Russia's plan here in the United States. And then he started hearing all these deals were going through, and you know, you heard him say he was shocked he was appalled when he heard these deals actually went through.), Block(571124289-240,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,240,
 Let me play one more. William Campbell says he was assured the Obama White House had been informed of his information. So it went to the highest level, Robert Mueller was the FBI director. Hillary is the secretary of state. Then the money flows to Bill Clinton doubling his speaking fees. Money going from people involved in this. Bill Clinton foundation.), Block(571124289-241,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,241,
But he says here Obama knew and he did nothing. Let's play this.), Block(571124289-242,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,242,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-243,Hannity-571124289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,243,
 I was assured that the White House also had been informed because of the importance on a national security side and it was actually a very enthusiastic commendation that I received from the FBI because my work had resulted in the White House daily brief being handed to then President Obama.), Block(571124289-244,Hannity-571124289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,244,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(571124289-245,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,245,
 Then he said the president knew about all of this. Robert Mueller knew about all of this. We import, Alison, you know, almost 90 percent of our uranium. We don't have enough. And it all happened and they had 18 months with an informant inside. How could this ever happen?), Block(571124289-246,Hannity-571124289,SPANN,246,
 Look, right now you have you Democrats calling for stricter restrictions on Russia, saying that Russians are bad actors. But then you know under their watch you had an FBI informant inside ROSATOM telling the U.S. government, hey, this is Russia's plan. They are trying to make the United States dependent on Russian uranium.), Block(571124289-247,Hannity-571124289,SPANN,247,
And during that time when he was giving them this information you had the deal with Uranium One go through. You had the Russians garner billions of dollars' worth of new nuclear fuel contracts and they were able to get a hold of a large percent of the United States uranium. So, it is shocking.), Block(571124289-248,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,248,
 Yes. All right, Alison, thank you for sharing the tape. We appreciate it. Joining us with more reaction, Fox News contributor Sara Carter. You have you spent hours, Sara, with this informant. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what he is saying. But he knew the whole time the White House knew, Hillary knew, Mueller knew. Crimes were being committed, nobody stopped it. Why?), Block(571124289-249,Hannity-571124289,SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR,249,
 That's right. It's been almost a year since I've known the informant. And the trove of information, Sean that he has delivered is incredible.), Block(571124289-250,Hannity-571124289,SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR,250,
Now, I believe and right now we know that the FBI has questioned him that they are looking into this they've reopened the Clinton Foundation investigation and they are looking at those ties between Russia, Russians with ROSATOM oligarch that actually had connections with the Clinton Foundation.), Block(571124289-251,Hannity-571124289,SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR,251,
And this is really important because for a long time people believed that the FBI had just shut down these investigations and that they were no longer looking at it. What we know now is that they are and that they've interviewed William Douglas Campbell.), Block(571124289-252,Hannity-571124289,SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR,252,
Another really important factor here that a lot of people need to realize is that during this time in 2010, he also provided the United States government with sufficient evidence that Russia was also providing all kinds of assistance to Iran with their nuclear program.), Block(571124289-253,Hannity-571124289,SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR,253,
And what's important about that is that in 2010 Obama basically lifted the sanctions on Russia. They reset with Russia. The sanctions that have been put in place by the Bush administration. So--), Block(571124289-254,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,254,
 You know--), Block(571124289-255,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,255,
(CROSSTALK)), Block(571124289-256,Hannity-571124289,CARTER,256,
 Even though President Obama had all this information, he still reset with Russia. They moved forward and we can see what happened after that with the Uranium One deal.), Block(571124289-257,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,257,
 It is so ironic in light of the phony Trump Russia, you know, narrative that the media pushes every second of every day. And the Clinton and the media talking points on this have been this story has been debunk.), Block(571124289-258,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,258,
But we learned that this informant who you know and spent many, many hours with and very well aware of all of the evidence that he has available and that he is now presenting, he testified and spoke to the FBI field office investigators into the Clinton Foundation. I always say in these cases follow the money. Where does the money now lead us now that we know an investigation is going on that the story has not been debunk?), Block(571124289-259,Hannity-571124289,CARTER,259,
 I think what's going to happen here, Sean, in talking to people in law enforcement, federal law enforcement who have conducted these types of investigations and people who actually were on this investigation from the beginning, they are going to start tracing the money.), Block(571124289-260,Hannity-571124289,CARTER,260,
He provided the foundation. He provided the evidence, the players, who was involved, what they talked about the laundering, the schemes that were going on. And now what they got to do is look at those players and trace that money. See where the money went. The money that went even to Bill Clinton, remember, from renaissance capital which was the Russian bank basically run by SSB agents, which is their spies that paid Bill Clinton half a million dollars in 2010 for a speech.), Block(571124289-261,Hannity-571124289,CARTER,261,
Other money that may have gone through lobbying firms that were then giving, you know, the Bill -- the global initiative part of the Clinton Foundation basically free services after the money came through them.), Block(571124289-262,Hannity-571124289,CARTER,262,
So they are going to be tracing this money. They are going to be following that money and hopefully it will lead to some answers and could be a lot of trouble for Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.), Block(571124289-263,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,263,
 All right. We're going to see a lot of this coming. There is -- this was in December. This informant was interviewed by the FBI field office in Little Rock. All right, Sara Carter. Great work.), Block(571124289-264,Hannity-571124289,HANNITY,264,
