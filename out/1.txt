 Hey, Tucker. Great show as always.), Block(916724289-5,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,5,
And welcome to 'Hannity.'), Block(916724289-6,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,6,
Multiple 
ing news stories to bring you tonight.), Block(916724289-7,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,7,
First, there is a showdown brewing at this hour in the sanctuary state of California, with some now revolting against that state's insane policies that literally shield criminal illegal immigrants.), Block(916724289-8,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,8,
One California county has a new plan to buck the Golden State policies and actually help ICE enforce America's immigration laws. The undersheriff from Orange County who is fighting back, he will join us exclusively tonight.), Block(916724289-9,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,9,
Plus, we will show you all out hysteria coming from the left after the Commerce Department announced that the 2020 census will actually ask respondents if they're citizens. Now, citizens questioned on the census, the horror. The American left is in a complete meltdown tonight.), Block(916724289-10,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,10,
And after all but guaranteeing a wall on the southern border, the president is now closer tonight than you think to fulfilling that important campaign promise. We have those details.), Block(916724289-11,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,11,
And also, President Trump is now getting tough on Russia. The mainstream media is spinning in circles. Didn't they claim he'd never get tough on Russia?), Block(916724289-12,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,12,
Plus, we have brand new discoveries tonight to bring that you could reveal even more bias and corruption, believe it or not, at the highest levels of the FBI.), Block(916724289-13,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,13,
Sit tight. We have a lot of information that we're going to get in tonight.), Block(916724289-14,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,14,
Jeff Zucker, I hope you are watching.), Block(916724289-15,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,15,
Tonight's 
ing news opening monologue.), Block(916724289-16,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,16,
(MUSIC) HANNITY: This January, radical left wing California Governor Jerry 'Moonbeam' Brown, he signed a bill into law making California a sanctuary state. In other words, California's lawless lawmakers are now literally barring police from determining the citizenship status of anyone charged with a crime thereby preventing the federal government from effectively deporting criminal illegal immigrants and enforcing federal law.), Block(916724289-17,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,17,
But now, some localities, they are starting to fight back. The city of Los Alamitos, that's in Orange County, California, they voted earlier this month to actively defy the state sanctuary status. And early today, Orange County supervisors, they followed suit and they have voted to join President Trump's lawsuit against California.), Block(916724289-18,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,18,
And in the meantime, while the county's sheriff's office now implemented a new plan to skirt California's insane sanctuary laws. They're actually going to assist the federal government in deporting illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes and, of course, those standing in the way of the rule of law.), Block(916724289-19,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,19,
The plan is really simple. The Orange County sheriff's office will now make the names and release dates for every prisoner publicly available in an online database called 'Who's in Jail?' This will allow ICE to cross-reference identities and deport those illegal immigrants that are convicted of crimes and, of course, a threat to society.), Block(916724289-20,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,20,
And in response, the attorney general of California, well, he is now issuing a veiled threat to those that challenge California's sanctuary status which, of course, defies federal law. Watch this.), Block(916724289-21,Hannity-916724289,SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST,21,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-22,Hannity-916724289,XAVIER BECERRA, CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL,22,
 I have to take a closer look at what Orange County is saying and possibly doing. State law is state law. And it's my job to enforce state law. I will do so. And we want to make sure that every jurisdiction, including Orange County, understand what state law requires of the people and the subdivisions of the state of California.), Block(916724289-23,Hannity-916724289,XAVIER BECERRA, CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL,23,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-24,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,24,
 I actually dare the attorney general of California to do this. If he does, that means the Oakland mayor can be arrested by the federal government for aiding and abetting criminal illegal aliens by tipping them off that they're going to enforce the law.), Block(916724289-25,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,25,
We'll have a lot more on this later in the show when the Orange County under sheriff will join us.), Block(916724289-26,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,26,
Also tonight, the California lunacy continues. That state is now set to sue the Trump administration yet again this time over a question on the upcoming 2020 U.S. census. The census will ask non-respondents or those that want to respond, are you a U.S. citizen? That's it.), Block(916724289-27,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,27,
The California attorney general tweeted that the question is, quote, not just a bad idea also illegal. Mr. Attorney General, I beg to differ.), Block(916724289-28,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,28,
There was even more hysteria of course in the left wing, abusively biased so-called mainstream media. Watch this.), Block(916724289-29,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,29,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-30,Hannity-916724289,MIKE PESCA, SLATE,30,
 What do we want from the census? We want an accurate count. Let's defer to the experts. Will this help with accuracy? It will not, because people will not answer the question.), Block(916724289-31,Hannity-916724289,UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE,31,
 Let's be realistic about this? Do we think this is about getting an accurate view of the census and protecting voting rights, or is it to and, in fact, suppress minority voting?), Block(916724289-32,Hannity-916724289,UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE,32,
 So, the Justice Department's motivation here seems to be quite so arose for adding a question that could very seriously depress participation and result in a failed census all together.), Block(916724289-33,Hannity-916724289,KRISTEN WELKER, NBC,33,
 What do you say to critics who argue that ultimately, this is a way to target immigrants, that it's going to be fewer resources for immigrant communities?), Block(916724289-34,Hannity-916724289,KRISTEN WELKER, NBC,34,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-35,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,35,
 The main goal of the census has always been to determine demographic information about the population that lives inside the United States.), Block(916724289-36,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,36,
But, the left, members of the biased press, they want you to believe that we aren't allowed to determine how many citizens versus noncitizens are actually living here. That makes no sense considering congressional districts are literally made up of what the population is. Nothing says that responsible immigration policy, you know, like well who is living in your country, really hard question. We'll have more on that in a second.), Block(916724289-37,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,37,
When it does come to the wall on the southern border, there is some big news out of Washington. According to reports, the president will use military and national defense funding to cover initial construction cost of the law, citing what is a clear national security risks presented by unprotected borders. This is a huge step forward for the administration and it would be a political victory and serious progress, of course, to battle and secure our borders.), Block(916724289-38,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,38,
Here's what the deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley had to say about this on 'Fox & Friends' earlier today.), Block(916724289-39,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,39,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-40,Hannity-916724289,AINSLEY EARHARDT, FOX NEWS,40,
 The president is now saying or he kind of hinted around at least on Twitter over the weekend that he could use all of that military funding, there was a lot of military funding going into the pocketbooks of those men and women that are fighting for our country, but there was a lot extra money to be used, more than what they asked for, more than what the White House asked for. So, there is talk that he might use that extra money to build the wall since he didn't get the funding, he only got 1.6 --), Block(916724289-41,Hannity-916724289,STEVE DOOCY, FOX NEWS,41,
 That was his Twitter.), Block(916724289-42,Hannity-916724289,EARHARDT,42,
 Yes, right. His Twitter was saying might use this to -- the military money -- to fund the wall. Is that going to happen?), Block(916724289-43,Hannity-916724289,HOGAN GIDLEY, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY,43,
 Well, I don't want to get ahead of his announcement. But I can say, this is one reason that the --), Block(916724289-44,Hannity-916724289,DOOCY,44,
 Wait, what announcement?), Block(916724289-45,Hannity-916724289,GIDLEY,45,
 Well, if is he going to make announcement, how he spends that money to build wall. But I can say that's one of the victories for the American people in this piece of legislation that president pushed, which was actually building a wall.), Block(916724289-46,Hannity-916724289,GIDLEY,46,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-47,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,47,
 So, when the funding becomes reality, President Trump will be fulfilling a major campaign promise. Don't forget, the president has already started to look for prototypes for this wall.), Block(916724289-48,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,48,
Another top story tonight. The destroyed Trump press, they are spinning in circles after more than a year obsessing over Russia, Russia, Russia collusion. Well, the media's fragile narrative, of course, is crumbling right before their eyes.), Block(916724289-49,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,49,
The left said President Trump would never ever be tough on Russia. You might remember this daily hysteria. Take a look.), Block(916724289-50,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,50,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-51,Hannity-916724289,JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR,51,
 I think he's afraid of the president of Russia.), Block(916724289-52,Hannity-916724289,WILLIE GEIST, MSNBC,52,
 Why?), Block(916724289-53,Hannity-916724289,BRENNAN,53,
 Well, I think one could speculate as to why, that the Russians may have something on him personally that they could always roll out and make his life more difficult.), Block(916724289-54,Hannity-916724289,WILLIAM COHAN, VANITY FAIR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT,54,
 It's so clear at this point that Vladimir Putin and his associates, somebody has something on Donald Trump.), Block(916724289-55,Hannity-916724289,ELI STOKOLS, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST,55,
 That may be something that turns the key on the Russia probe, is figuring out why this president is so deferential to Putin and to Russia. And if there is some sort of kompromat that they have on him.), Block(916724289-56,Hannity-916724289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,56,
 Donald Trump is afraid a political hurricane is out there at sea for him. We'll call it hurricane Vladimir, if you will, the whole Russian thing.), Block(916724289-57,Hannity-916724289,JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST,57,
 They make these decisions time and time again in a way that makes it appear that they're hostages, that he's Vladimir Putin's hostage.), Block(916724289-58,Hannity-916724289,JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST,58,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-59,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,59,
 That was just last week. Oh, they have something on Trump. He can't act against Putin.), Block(916724289-60,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,60,
Well, yesterday, the Trump administration, they announced tough new actions against Vladimir Putin and his regime in response to the poisoning of a former spy and his daughter in Great Britain. Oh, the Trump policy includes the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats, the closure of Russia's consulate in Seattle.), Block(916724289-61,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,61,
It's pretty tough, make no mistake. This is a very aggressive move against Putin's regime. It sends a powerful message that the United States and our allies are not going to bow down to Moscow. And I guess they don't have anything on Trump.), Block(916724289-62,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,62,
Even former CIA director turned CNN shill Michael Hayden, he's praising President Trump. Wow, hell has frozen over. Let's look.), Block(916724289-63,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,63,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-64,Hannity-916724289,MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR,64,
 So, felt familiar. Felt a bit like old times. Now, look at what just happened. We are tough on Russia. We acted in concert with our allies globally. The United States took a leadership role, very un-Trumpian. And so, I'm very happy to see it.), Block(916724289-65,Hannity-916724289,MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR,65,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-66,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,66,
 Glad we can make you happy. General Hayden is right.), Block(916724289-67,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,67,
But some in the media, they are still doing whatever they can to discredit President Trump's latest move. By the way, Obama never did anything this tough. He was telling Dmitry Medvedev -- tell Vladimir I'll have more flexibility after the election.), Block(916724289-68,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,68,
Watch this.), Block(916724289-69,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,69,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-70,Hannity-916724289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,70,
 There was almost like the old days where the United States and allies something of a position. The not so good part of this, Joe, this is foreign policy on auto pilot.), Block(916724289-71,Hannity-916724289,MIKE BARNICLE, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR,71,
 We still could have done a lot more. If we really want to hurt the Russians and Putin specifically, you go after the banks here, where there is still a lot of Russian money being housed.), Block(916724289-72,Hannity-916724289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,72,
 I think what's happened is the allies have kind of shamed the president into this action today. We would be standing alone obviously if we didn't do something. It allows the president cover. He can say, look, I'm tough on Russia. But Putin is laughing at Trump tonight because he knows he has license to do whatever he wants.), Block(916724289-73,Hannity-916724289,WOLF BLITZER, CNN,73,
 Did the administration send a strong enough signal?), Block(916724289-74,Hannity-916724289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,74,
 Not yet. If you want to send a strong signal, I think at some point have you got to look at some money sanctions. You've got to get at Putin and the individuals around him.), Block(916724289-75,Hannity-916724289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,75,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(916724289-76,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,76,
 You mean like President Trump pursuing energy independence? That is the heart of the Russian economy? And guess what? That will hurt Vladimir Putin and any economic chances of growth that he has.), Block(916724289-77,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,77,
I told you, journalism is dead and buried in this country. So, it's not surprising to hear the media bending over backwards to bash President Trump even when he does something tough and strong and good. You're not going to hear this from the so-called journalists over at these other networks.), Block(916724289-78,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,78,
But it is important to remember this is the latest tough action from the Trump administration because they won't tell you but earlier in March, the president announced critical new economic sanctions against Russia in response to election meddling. In February, around 300 Kremlin-linked Russian mercenaries were killed or wounded by the U.S. military. That following Russia's aggressive actions near a base in Syria where Americans were stationed.), Block(916724289-79,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,79,
And, of course, this all comes after President Obama essentially did nothing but appease and ignore and suck up to Vladimir Putin year after year.), Block(916724289-80,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,80,
Tonight Russia is vowing to retaliate against the Trump administration's tough actions -- oh, maybe they will release the information they have on Trump.), Block(916724289-81,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,81,
But unlike the Obama administration, President Trump -- well, he is not going to take hostile actions by Russia very lightly. And meanwhile, now that the media is Russia, Russia, Russia narrative has fallen apart. It's Stormy, Stormy, Stormy, and more Stormy taking center stage.), Block(916724289-82,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,82,
And desperate to find some kind of division between President Trump and his supporters, well, fake news CNN, they actually, amazingly held a focus group. They did it with Christian female Trump supporters. They wanted to get their reaction to Anderson Cooper's really, really bizarre and creepy interview with Stormy Daniels and, of course, Karen McDougal.), Block(916724289-83,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,83,
Unfortunately, for fake news, CNN, well, the group session didn't exactly go as they hoped it would and you can actually see the reaction in their so-called journalists. Take a look.), Block(916724289-84,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,84,

Meanwhile, over at CNN, the king of porn soon to be really scandal plagued, Jeff Zucker -- just saying, by the way, Jeff, we know. And best friend of Matt Lauer, by the way, it's an open secret and the chief of fake news, and his number one news anchor Anderson Cooper, they're now desperately trying to rehabilitate their reputation tonight after Jerry Springer Jr., Anderson creepy Cooper had his interviews with Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels.), Block(916724289-99,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,99,

As Meadows points out, now, it's pretty important to note this text came just days after the FBI began their Russia investigation and right after they exonerated Hillary Clinton.

Which brings us to our next story tonight that is now 
ing from Sara Carter. According to her sources, the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has finally literally complied with the judge's order to hand over all of the evidence in Mueller's case that he has against General Michael Flynn to authorities and attorneys. This comes as some are now speculated that Mueller intentionally withheld information that would be exculpatory to Flynn in order to garner a plea deal.), Block(916724289-163,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,163,

This is huge because the judge we're talking about is the judge that was involved in the Ted Stephens case. He is the one that found that exculpatory evidence was withheld in that case. We know that both Weissmann and Robert Mueller have in their histories withholding exculpatory evidence.), Block(916724289-165,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,165,
This judge sounded ticked off. He wants to make the decision. Does that now mean General Flynn might be withdrawing that plea and maybe even exonerated?), Block(916724289-166,Hannity-916724289,SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR,166,
 That's what we don't know. What we do know and what's really fascinating, Sean, is that the judge mandated this order after Flynn pled guilty which is highly unusual, right? This is very unusual.), Block(916724289-167,Hannity-916724289,SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR,167,
So, he did it after the guilty plea. That means that this order supersedes the plea agreement that Flynn had with Mueller. And what they asked for was all evidence, all information, even that which would be favorable to Flynn.), Block(916724289-168,Hannity-916724289,SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR,168,
They also said and the judge stipulated this, that even if you believe the evidence that you have obtained has nothing to do with this case, you still have to turn it over to me. And then I will make the decision whether or not to turn that information over to Flynn's attorneys, Robert Kelner.), Block(916724289-169,Hannity-916724289,SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR,169,
So, the judge is taking this very seriously. They want all of this -- they wanted him to turn over all of this information. He has complied, according to the sources I have spoken with. And as you've said, special counsel has not commented on this. Neither has Robert Kelner, so I don't know where he's going to go forward. We know that in May, they're going to go before the judge again and then they're going to arrange what we believe to be with the sentencing hearing.), Block(916724289-170,Hannity-916724289,SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR,170,

 The two agents who interviewed Michael Flynn are percipient witnesses. They're very important in any case against Flynn. If they walked out of that interview as we now know and told the Attorney General Yates and James Comey, there is no crime here by Flynn, he's telling the truth, his recollection may be slightly different than we interpreted the transcript of his conversation with the Russian ambassador, but that's not a crime.), Block(916724289-183,Hannity-916724289,GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST,183,

And the legal immigrants that I spoke to although they want what's best for their fellow immigrants they believe in the rule of law and they want to be safe in their community because they feel that they're Americans. That's what I heard today.), Block(916724289-363,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,363,
 And remember, the president said I want to build a big wall on the southern border with the big door. But just asking people to do illegally.), Block(916724289-364,Hannity-916724289,LAHREN,364,
 Well, I thnk that that's what I have been asking people for weeks now in California and they agree. I think that the left has just dominated this conversation about the wall and it's become just a talking point at this point. But if you really 
 it down people want security, they want safety, they want the immigration process to be reformed. They want common sense and the wall is common sense.), Block(916724289-365,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,365,
 Yes.), Block(916724289-366,Hannity-916724289,LAHREN,366,
 It's just the left has dominated this conversation and they've made the wall some kind of a demon object and it's not. It's for the safety of Americans.), Block(916724289-367,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,367,
 All right. Tomi, thanks so much for doing that. Great job tonight. Joining us now with more on this decision is the Orange County California Undersheriff Don Barnes is with us.), Block(916724289-368,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,368,
Sir, first, I want to applaud you. Secondly, I kind of took what your attorney general in California said as a threat. In other words, he would almost insinuating he might try to arrest you for just putting out who is in jail and when they are getting released. Isn't that legal?), Block(916724289-369,Hannity-916724289,DON BARNES, UNDERSHERIFF, ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA,369,
 Well, it is completely legal. It's under the -- under the law that was passed under Senate bill 54 there is a provision that says where we clearly cannot do which is we cannot communicate with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement but it says we can make this information available to make it available to the public which is exactly what we've done yesterday.), Block(916724289-370,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,370,
 Yes.), Block(916724289-371,Hannity-916724289,BARNES,371,
 So we are following the law and we have an obligation to follow the law.), Block(916724289-372,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,372,
 Doesn't the state of California, when you have an Oakland mayor, again, the ICE -- ICE was trying to enforce laws against criminal illegal immigrants. Those that committed other crimes beyond that, which was not respecting our laws and sovereignty.), Block(916724289-373,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,373,
If I were to give people a warning that you were about to go in and hold them accountable for crimes. Would I be aiding and abetting and obstructing justice?), Block(916724289-374,Hannity-916724289,BARNES,374,
 Well, potentially. But that I think that would be a little bit of a stretch. This is what we are very clearly doing, we are going after very serious offenders who are in custody of our jail and are being convicted of some very serious crimes.), Block(916724289-375,Hannity-916724289,BARNES,375,
SB-54 allows to us notify ICE on those that were under the Trust Act which was passed in 2014 at previously passed legislation and that's what we are doing. We are still notifying ICE, the sheriff has that discretion.), Block(916724289-376,Hannity-916724289,BARNES,376,
Last year we turned over 580. We have 57,000 bookings. So that's a small percentage or actually just 58,000. This year we've already turned over 181. But 244 individuals were not turned over to ICE. And that's what we're concerned about.), Block(916724289-377,Hannity-916724289,BARNES,377,
So they are very serious crimes and they are being returned back into the community. And quite honestly, back into the communities in which they preyed upon and committed their crimes to begin with, so we are trying to help the community to be safer by turning these individuals over to ICE and not letting them return to the communities and commit more crime.), Block(916724289-378,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,378,
 Do you have a response to the attorney general and the comments that he made tonight, because I took them as a little threatening towards you.), Block(916724289-379,Hannity-916724289,BARNES,379,
 Well, they were threatening. But I would say my hope would be that it would lead -- read the language of the law that was passed. It very clearly says in there what we can and cannot do. We cannot communicate with ICE which in and of itself a challenge. It's returning us back to a pre- 9/11 condition legislatively where we can't talk with other federal law enforcement agencies. That's problematic on its face. But it also has a provision where we can't make this information available publicly.), Block(916724289-380,Hannity-916724289,BARNES,380,
It's the information made available publicly and every inmate within our custody of the jail who has a since expiration date. Not those who are here illegally. Every inmate in our care has that information posted online. So we are not designating anybody. Anybody can go sift through that information and find out who's here. Now if ICE is looking for anything--), Block(916724289-381,Hannity-916724289,BARNES,381,
(CROSSTALK)), Block(916724289-382,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,382,
 Sheriff, if he does do anything, I promise you I will do everything in my power to help mobilize people to assist and help you in any way we can. Thank you for standing up for the rule of law.), Block(916724289-383,Hannity-916724289,BARNES,383,
 You are welcome, Sean. Thanks for having me.), Block(916724289-384,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,384,
 When we come back, an incredible emotional display of camaraderie. It will 
 your heart. That's next.), Block(916724289-385,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,385,

 Our video of the day to pick a heart
ing display of incredible camaraderie, thousands of New York City firefighters and firefighters from all around the country lined the streets of New York City today to pay tribute to one of their own who died while battling a five alarm fire last week.), Block(916724289-387,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,387,
Thirty-seven-year-old Michael Davidson, 15-year veteran firefighter suffered critical injuries fighting a basement fire on a movie set in Harlem in New York on Thursday night. And according to the New York Post, Davidson had separated from the rest of his unit after they were forced to retreat due to the severity of the flames.), Block(916724289-388,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,388,
Now Davidson ultimately ran out of compressed air and he collapsed while trying to escape. During his funeral service, which was held at beautiful St. Patrick's Cathedral, Davidson was remembered as, quote, 'a hero of the highest order.'), Block(916724289-389,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,389,
He sadly leaves behind a wife and four children. He is an American hero, and our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family tonight.), Block(916724289-390,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,390,
And if there is a go find me page we find out about, we will let you know about that, or a scholarship, and I'd be glad to donate myself. God bless that family. Very hard.), Block(916724289-391,Hannity-916724289,HANNITY,391,
