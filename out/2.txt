(MUSIC) HANNITY: So, the left-wing mainstream media's contempt for this president has now reached a boiling point and frankly a point of unhinged insanity. This is especially true for fake news CNN. For days, the Clinton news network, they have been completely and utterly obsessed with porn star Stormy Daniels and her salacious claims that she had a brief affair, a one-time encounter with Donald Trump some 12 or 13 years ago.

 Meanwhile, last night on '60 Minutes', Anderson Cooper sat down for as much anticipated interview with Stormy Daniels.

 Anderson really considered this hard news journalism.), Block(830324289-101,Hannity-830324289,HANITY,101,
Despite claims from Stormy's lawyer that his client was ready to disclose a mountain of evidence about Trump's misconduct, the only potentially newsworthy moment from the interview was when Stormy's claims that she was threatened by an unidentified man following her alleged affair with Mr. Trump, a one-time affair.), Block(830324289-102,Hannity-830324289,HANITY,102,
But even that claim wasn't backed up with any evidence, no evidence whatsoever. So, instead, we just got the embarrassing details of a supposed it or alleged one-night stand from over 12 years ago. Even some in the mainstream media, they are -- they are expressing their utter disappointment about Anderson's interviewing and hard-hitting journalism.

We have an attorney that's done just the opposite. He over promised. He sent out tweets with pictures of a CD-ROM suggesting some big explosion. He told us two weeks ago that she was threatened with assault and we would find out more on ' 60 Minutes', when in fact we found out nothing new on '60 Minutes'.), Block(830324289-107,Hannity-830324289,JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC,107,
So, what are you waiting for? What is the trigger that has you releasing the physical evidence?), Block(830324289-108,Hannity-830324289,JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC,108,
SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC I asked you whether there was any evidence, documentary evidence, text messages, photo evidence that that verified that Stormy Daniels had the affair she claims that she had. You said to me that's a question that Ms. Daniels will have to ultimately answer. Cut to last night, she's asked directly about this on '60 Minutes' and she says my attorney has instructed me not to answer.), Block(830324289-109,Hannity-830324289,JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC,109,

Now, four days right here on this program, we have been questioning if CNN's soon-to-be scandal-plagued chief Jeff Zucker has turned into the porn king.

And aside from Anderson's usually salacious interviews, the mainstream media's coverage of Daniels and McDougal is revealing a huge double standard in this country.

Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, all women that accused a former president, Bill Clinton, of serial predator like gross sexual misconduct, and the Media Research Center, they crunch those numbers. And according to their count, 1994, when Paula Jones came forward with details about Bill Clinton dropping his pants and exposing himself to her in a hotel room, CBS and NBC actually ignored the story. ABC, to their credit, gave a whopping 16 seconds of coverage.), Block(830324289-143,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,143,
And then in 1997, when Kathleen Willey's allegations about Bill Clinton became public, that he groped and grabbed and fondled and touched and kissed her against her will, oh, CBS and NBC gave it one minute and 34 seconds of coverage, ABC didn't touch the story.), Block(830324289-144,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,144,

And in 1998, when news broke about Juanita Broaddrick's serious claims that she was raped by Bill Clinton in the '70s, ABC, CBS, they didn't find a spare second to cover it. And meanwhile, Lisa Myers from NBC, she booked the first interview with Juanita Broaddrick, and according to a report from 'The Washington Post', for over a month, NBC chief Andy Lack and others prevented the interview from airing because they said they were unable to corroborate her story.), Block(830324289-146,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,146,

But all of this hysterical coverage over Stormy Daniels, you know, we all know sex sells. OK, that's part of it.

 I cannot wait -- I cannot wait for it to come to a conclusion.), Block(830324289-393,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,393,
 Do you have any evidence so far?), Block(830324289-394,Hannity-830324289,GORKA,394,
 This is the diversion. This is the diversion.), Block(830324289-395,Hannity-830324289,AREU,395,
 It's not a diversion. I am simply waiting to find out with what is going to happen and what the results are.), Block(830324289-396,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,396,
 Waiting? Waiting, yes.), Block(830324289-397,Hannity-830324289,GORKA,397,

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)), Block(830324289-410,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,410,
 All right. Tonight's exclusive clip from 'The Hill 's' interview with the Uranium One FBI informant William Douglas Campbell's details. What he learned while undercover regarding Russia's role in the Iran nuclear program. This is so pivotal and the fact that the media cares about Stormy and not this is breathtaking to me.), Block(830324289-411,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,411,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(830324289-412,Hannity-830324289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,412,
 The people I was working with had been briefed by Moscow to keep a very low profile regarding Moscow's relationship with Tehran. Moscow was supplying equipment, nuclear equipment nuclear services to Iran and Moscow specifically the leadership in Moscow were concerned that it would offset the strategy they had here in the United States. If the United States understood the close relationship between Moscow and Tehran.), Block(830324289-413,Hannity-830324289,UNIDENTIFIED MALE,413,

 Here with more investigative reporter John Solomon and Campbell's attorney Victoria Toensing, a Fox News contributor, and investigative reporter Sara Carter and Greg Jarrett also with us.), Block(830324289-415,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,415,
OK, let me start with John, you interviewed him. I am actually going to interview Mr. Campbell on Wednesday of this week. You broke some now ground here. Explain what people just heard there. I mean, it's my plug.), Block(830324289-416,Hannity-830324289,JOHN SOLOMON, VICE PRESIDENT, THE HILL,416,
 Yes. It's very, very important. If you start what we started a few months ago we believe that there was one red flag, one reason for Barack Obama not to give all this uranium to the Russians in the forms of billions of dollars of contract the Uranium One sale. He approved all those things.), Block(830324289-417,Hannity-830324289,JOHN SOLOMON, VICE PRESIDENT, THE HILL,417,
We know for the first time that he also was passing along a second red flag. Russia, ROSATOM was assisting Iran's illicit nuclear program. He gave very specific details. And tonight after my story broke I got a call from some intelligence sources they gave me a little bit more information.), Block(830324289-418,Hannity-830324289,JOHN SOLOMON, VICE PRESIDENT, THE HILL,418,
Doug Campbell was providing information about the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant in Iran. Russia was helping that specifically plant. Why is that important? The U.S. was so concerned about that they eventually unleashed the Stuxnet virus for Israel targeting that very plant.), Block(830324289-419,Hannity-830324289,JOHN SOLOMON, VICE PRESIDENT, THE HILL,419,
So it was a place we were very concerned about. Doug Campbell was telling the Obama administration early on this is a problem.), Block(830324289-420,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,420,
 So, wait a minute. So what we are saying here, Sara, is that Campbell identifying this specific nuclear Russian plant, nuclear plant, the Iranian nuclear plant, but the Russians are helping.), Block(830324289-421,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,421,
Now that goes into the Obama deal to give them all of that money. That goes into Campbell knew all this 18 months before they signed off on the Uranium One deal? They knew about all the crimes.), Block(830324289-422,Hannity-830324289,SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS,422,
 Well, I think this is what's so important here, Sean for people to remember historically. When the Obama administration in 2010 decided to reset with Russia, they basically pulled away the sanctions that have been put in place by the Bush administration. And when they did that, it opened the gateway. It allowed the Russians to enter our uranium market, our energy market.), Block(830324289-423,Hannity-830324289,SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS,423,
But at the same time it allowed the Russians to continue working with the Iranians. And at that point in time, I mean, that Campbell was providing all of this information the Obama administration was well aware of it.), Block(830324289-424,Hannity-830324289,SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS,424,
And not only that, it also opened up the door for the SR-300 missiles, their defensive missiles that the Russians were going to sell and did sell to Iran so that they could defend these power plants that we were so intent on finding more information about these nuclear reactors that we believe they were using for their nuclear program.), Block(830324289-425,Hannity-830324289,SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS,425,
Not just for medical use but to build missiles to build war heads. And these nuclear power plants were so important at that time to our congressional leaders that they didn't want these any of these plants to go through. That's why there were so many people fighting the Uranium One deal.), Block(830324289-426,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,426,
 We are talking about, Victoria, the most important aspects of America's national security. He was involved -- he understood it was as an operative inside Putin's network from 2009, 18 months before the CFIUS approved this Uranium One deal.), Block(830324289-427,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,427,
A lot of this could have been avoided. I know it's not to the level of Stormy Daniels the porn star. But when it deals with -- Sara is laughing. But seriously, this is America's national security. And Congress, Victoria, literally the Democrats trying to attack your client who bravely got into this network and likely could have been killed, a 30 year operative.), Block(830324289-428,Hannity-830324289,VICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING FBI INFORMANT,428,
 Hey, Sean, you've done so much on this issue. And now it's time for Congress to act. I want you to get the members of the House Intel and Oversight Committee on the show and ask them why after five years, Doug Campbell gave detailed oral briefings to the FBI standing in the back of a government van as he describes it. For five years he gave them all kinds of written products to specify what was going on with the Russians.), Block(830324289-429,Hannity-830324289,VICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING FBI INFORMANT,429,
(CROSSTALK)), Block(830324289-430,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,430,
 Well, who was the FBI director at the time, it was Robert Mueller, right?), Block(830324289-431,Hannity-830324289,TOENSING,431,
 Yes. But it's Chris Reagen enact, no. It's time for Congress to issue a subpoena for those documents if they can't get it by a simple request. But to my knowledge, they haven't even requested it. And the other thing that Congress should ask for is the presidential briefings of President Obama during that time as daily presidential briefings.), Block(830324289-432,Hannity-830324289,TOENSING,432,
Because Mr. Campbell was told that the president was receiving information about this investigation. What did Obama know when he was sucking up to the Iranians and also sucking up to the Russians in 2009 and 2010?), Block(830324289-433,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,433,
 John, I only have about two minutes left. I want to get everybody in. You spent time around this man. And he has tried at the time to share it with Congress. Why didn't Congress want to hear this and why didn't the FBI do anything?), Block(830324289-434,Hannity-830324289,SOLOMON,434,
 Well, we don't know that the FBI didn't do anything. It's possible they reported this up the chain at the higher level and the policymaking structure. Someone made a decision we're going to turn the other way and try to get a deal with Russia. It's didn't happen and we got pleas for a lot of uranium contracts.), Block(830324289-435,Hannity-830324289,SOLOMON,435,
Congress has interviewed him but they haven't gone further in trying to get these documents. And I think the documents create a really clear story about how the United States was taken to the woodshed by Russia.), Block(830324289-436,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,436,
 Sara?), Block(830324289-437,Hannity-830324289,CARTER,437,
 Yes, I have to agree with John on this. I mean, look, they need to find out how much was actually shared with our intelligence community and how much did they act on and how little they acted on it at that time when it came to Uranium One when it came to our energy market. This is what Doug Campbell can provide. He provides a road map so that our Congress can investigate these issues. Fully investigate them and make them public.), Block(830324289-438,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,438,
 Last word, Victoria?), Block(830324289-439,Hannity-830324289,TOENSING,439,
 I want you to get those numbers on, Sean. You know I sometimes I get--), Block(830324289-440,Hannity-830324289,TOENSING,440,

 I have an immediate plan on Wednesday so I'll do that on Wednesday.), Block(830324289-442,Hannity-830324289,TOENSING,442,
 We're going to see you on Wednesday but I want to you get members of those committees on your show and say why aren't you asking for all of those documents?), Block(830324289-443,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,443,
 I know but it's not Stormy, how could anyone ever want to pay attention to something that actually impacts people's lives and national security and safety of the American people.), Block(830324289-444,Hannity-830324289,TOENSING,444,
 It's very sad.), Block(830324289-445,Hannity-830324289,HANNITY,445,

 The Obama Foundation could potentially create a platform for a young up-and-coming leaders, both in the United States but all around the world, to come together, meet together, create a digital platform.
