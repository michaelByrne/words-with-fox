 And welcome 'Hannity.' We have so much

And the head of fake news CNN, the soon to be scandal plagued Jeff Zucker, OK, you want to take pot shots at Fox News, Jeff, let's go. We're going to unveil our new nickname for the bleep hole network.), Block(484724289-6,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,6,
Plus, we're going to call out the hypocrisy of the media's news Stormy Daniels 24/7, 365, obsession, the same people that ignored Bill Clinton's accusers for decades. Oh, and by the way, in those cases, it wasn't always consensual, was it?), Block(484724289-7,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,7,
And also 
ing right now, H.R. McMaster is out and John Bolton is in, good news, as national security advisor.), Block(484724289-8,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,8,
Also, new tonight, President Trump's lead lawyer in the Russia witch hunt is now stepping aside. In an apparent move, it means the president, he is getting ready to fight back and fight back hard against this corrupt special counsel. Our investigation into the investigators continues tonight.), Block(484724289-9,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,9,
And the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Bob Goodlatte, he has now issued a subpoena for the DOJ to send over documents on the rigged Clinton e-mail investigation on FISA abuses, Andrew McCabe's firing, and Comey's firing.), Block(484724289-10,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,10,
The House Intel Committee has also announced their Russia probe is over and votes to publicly release the GOP's final report. There's new information in that. This report finds no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. It exposes deep state leaking, FISA abuse, and blasts the former director of national security, James Clapper, for giving inconsistent testimony just like McCabe about contacts with the media.), Block(484724289-11,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,11,
Is that lying under oath?), Block(484724289-12,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,12,
Also, a stunning investigative report tonight from Sara Carter, how the special counsel Robert Mueller and his top prosecutor, you know, the guy that they say is the pit bull for Mr. Mueller, Andrew Weissmann, he's directly tied to two of the biggest scandals in FBI history.

And also, an exclusive tonight, you've heard about the Uranium One informant.

And according to 'The Hollywood Reporter', Zucker recently blasting Fox News's, quote, propaganda machine and state-run TV.), Block(484724289-16,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,16,
By the way, Fox News like every newspaper in the country, they have a sports page, they have a news page, a gossip page and they have an editorial page. Oh, opinion programming.), Block(484724289-17,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,17,
He even went on to say that this network does, quote, a disservice to the country. This is coming from the man whose so-called cable news station, CNN, is literally nicknamed the bleep-hole network because they have an obsession with the word you might remember this.), Block(484724289-18,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,18,

(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(484724289-65,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,65,
 It's about an alleged affair, not proven, and, of course, very different from Bill Clinton and Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and, of course, Paula Jones.), Block(484724289-66,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,66,
But CNN's obsessive 24/7 coverage doesn't end with Stormy Daniels. They're also now giving a former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal, they're giving her plenty of air time and again, we're talking about potentially, alleged, consensual relationships.), Block(484724289-67,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,67,
And we're going to compare how they covered, oh, assaults and exposing one self and even rape with Bill Clinton. All this effort, of course, in this case, to destroy Donald Trump. Take a look.), Block(484724289-68,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,68,

cooper: So when was the next communication?), Block(484724289-70,Hannity-484724289,KAREN MCDOUGAL,70,
 I believe we talked right away on the phone. And I think we talked for about a week on the phone before his next visit to L.A. And that was his birthday, which I think is June 12th.), Block(484724289-71,Hannity-484724289,COOPER,71,
 Would he call you?), Block(484724289-72,Hannity-484724289,MCDOUGAL,72,
 He would call me. I would call him, vice versa.), Block(484724289-73,Hannity-484724289,MCDOUGAL,73,

 Well, CNN's new obsession.), Block(484724289-75,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,75,
We might have a brand new name for their leader, their chief, their CEO, Jeff Zucker, the porn king of cable news.), Block(484724289-76,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,76,
Of course, porn king Jeff Zucker and his colleagues at the bleep-hole network, they're not alone in their Stormy obsession. NBC, ABC, CBS and others also featuring saturated coverage of the story.), Block(484724289-77,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,77,
Predictably, the same level of media interest was not present back in the early 1990s when then-President Bill Clinton was accused of having multiple extramarital affairs and even worse, engaging in serious instances of sexual misconduct. By the way, in the case of Gennifer Flowers, she was proven right but I remember James Carville -- oh, he worked and was one of the people talking about it or dragging her through a trailer park about Paula Jones.), Block(484724289-78,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,78,
Remember Paula Jones? She accused Bill Clinton of literally pulling down his pants and exposing himself. And according to the Media Research Center, the first three days of that scandal, ABC provided a whopping 16 seconds of coverage. NBC, CBS, they ignored it.), Block(484724289-79,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,79,
And next, there's the case of Kathleen Willey, and she said that Bill Clinton groped, grabbed, fondled, touched, kissed her against her will inside the Oval Office. That story 
s, how's your fake news handle it? ABC ignores it, NBC, CBS gave it a whopping 34 seconds of coverage, again, according to the Media Research Center. CNN, meanwhile, they dedicated 26 seconds of coverage during their evening newscast.), Block(484724289-80,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,80,
Then, of course, you have the serious allegation of rape, Juanita Broaddrick. And I interviewed Juanita Broaddrick, one of the toughest interviews I ever did. This surfaced first in 1998. Media Research Center tells us ABC, CBS totally ignored the 
ing story. NBC aired seven minutes of coverage, but not before initially spiking its pre-taped interview with Juanita Broaddrick.), Block(484724289-81,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,81,
This proves what I've been saying about journalism since, what, 2007 or '08, it's dead and buried in this country. We'll have more in this later in the show.), Block(484724289-82,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,82,
Also tonight, John Dowd, the lead lawyer for President Trump's legal team for dealing with Robert Mueller's witch hunt has resigned. And just a few hours ago, Fox has confirmed that Victoria Toensing will be joining the president's legal team.), Block(484724289-83,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,83,
And President Trump is also 
ing news saying that he would like to do a sit-down with the special counsel. Let's delve into this.), Block(484724289-84,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,84,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)), Block(484724289-85,Hannity-484724289,DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,85,
 Thank you very much.), Block(484724289-86,Hannity-484724289,REPORTER,86,
 Would you like to testify in front of Robert Mueller, sir?), Block(484724289-87,Hannity-484724289,TRUMP,87,
 Thank you. Sure, I would like to.), Block(484724289-88,Hannity-484724289,TRUMP,88,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(484724289-89,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,89,
 I'm sure the president would. And my advice to the president, you got to be very careful.), Block(484724289-90,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,90,
I've been warning everybody about Robert Mueller and his merry band of Democratic donors. We know for a fact Robert Mueller is conducting a biased, partisan, totally flawed investigation. He's gone way beyond his mandate, his original purpose. It was supposed to be about finding evidence of Trump-Russia collusion but we haven't found it in over a year, almost a year and a half now.), Block(484724289-91,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,91,
That's why he was appointed. It is not what he is doing. As constitutional law expert and liberal Democrat, professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard, he is pointing that special counsels exist to bring about charges, justify their existence. Doesn't matter if it is at all connected to what they're supposed to be investigating. They have to do all of this to justify their existence at an enormous cost not only to the American taxpayers, all of you, but also to the culture and society.), Block(484724289-92,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,92,
This Mueller witch hunt has been going on for over a year. And so far, he's found nothing regarding Trump-Russia collusion.), Block(484724289-93,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,93,
And the president, by the way, has every reason to be upset. Here's why: Mueller's team has more Democratic donors than a liberal Hollywood fundraiser. And not one of Mueller's partisan witch hunters donated to Trump. Every single Republican in Washington not named Donald Trump would crack under this kind of pressure.), Block(484724289-94,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,94,
So, yes, completely understandable when you appoint a team that donates to Obama, the DNC, Hillary Clinton and they're all going after one guy and not one person that donated to Trump? Of course, the president wants to fight back, because the special counsel from day one, has been abusively biased and many on that team have questionable ethics, they have horrific backgrounds, and they're out to destroy you.), Block(484724289-95,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,95,
By the way, saying 'I'm not guilty', that's how any innocent person would act.), Block(484724289-96,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,96,
Rod Rosenstein, he's stacked the deck against President Trump by appointing his buddy, Robert Mueller. He has conflicts himself. And then James Comey admitted he leaked the memos to get the special counsel appointed, and, of course, it happened. This is one big giant incestuous deep state cabal that is trying to unseat a duly elected president. All right. We'll have more on that.), Block(484724289-97,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,97,
Also 
ing this hour, H.R. McMaster has resigned as national security advisor, and he will be replaced by John Bolton. This is a huge improvement. We'll have more that.), Block(484724289-98,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,98,
And tonight, the House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte has issued a subpoena to the DOJ, demanding documents on this fixed Clinton email investigation, which never was an investigation. Also about severe FISA abuse and on Andrew McCabe's firing.), Block(484724289-99,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,99,
And Chairman Goodlatte, he notes in a press release, and this is something we have been reporting on, Congress has requested 1.2 million DOJ, FBI documents related to the Clinton investigation. The inspector general has them, why won't they turn them over?), Block(484724289-100,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,100,
'The Hill' is reporting that Chairman Goodlatte is trying to determine whether or not Comey lied under oath. He's requesting those documents as well. And so far, Congress has only received of the 1.2 million, 3,000.), Block(484724289-101,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,101,
Well, that sounds like obstruction. That doesn't sound like the wheels of justice or equal justice under the law. The DOJ is stonewalling, they're preventing Congress from conducting their constitutional job, which is oversight.), Block(484724289-102,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,102,
Remember, Rod Rosenstein sucking up to Paul Ryan in the final hours, please don't let Congress have access to the truth about FISA abuses. And we all know the Clinton email investigation was a sham, but Comey Strzok, Lisa Page, McCabe, and probably Loretta Lynch all part of putting the fix in. And on FISA abuses, the memos have exposed that the FBI and DOJ used, what, unverified, because they're not true. Clinton bought and paid for dossier, Russian lies, to get a FISA judge to get a warrant to spy on Carter Page, Trump associate, which then allows them to spy on the entire Trump campaign.), Block(484724289-103,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,103,
And we know the bulk of the FISA investigation, according to the Grassley- Graham memo was made up of the phony Clinton dossier, full of Russia and Russian government lies and propaganda. And as Andrew McCabe testified, without no dossier, there never would have even been a FISA warrant application.), Block(484724289-104,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,104,
And as for McCabe, his comments after being fired, well, to put his buddy James Comey in serious legal jeopardy. Remember, in a statement, McCabe writes in part: the OIG investigation is focused on investigation I chose to share with the reporter through my public affairs officer in the legal counselor. As deputy director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that and it was not a secret, it took place over several days. And others, including the director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter.), Block(484724289-105,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,105,
By the way he's not addressing lying under oath.), Block(484724289-106,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,106,
So, according to McCabe, Comey knew he was leaking information to the media which is in part why McCabe got fired, and then lying under oath also contributed. Well, McCabe is saying now, is very different from what James Comey said back in May of 2017.), Block(484724289-107,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,107,
Who do you believe, Comey or McCabe? We'll let you decide.), Block(484724289-108,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,108,

SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY, RâIOWA: Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?), Block(484724289-110,Hannity-484724289,JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR,110,
 Never.), Block(484724289-111,Hannity-484724289,GRASSLEY,111,
 Question two on relatively related. Have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?), Block(484724289-112,Hannity-484724289,COMEY,112,
 No.), Block(484724289-113,Hannity-484724289,COMEY,113,
(END VIDEO CLIP)), Block(484724289-114,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,114,
 You got to wonder if George Stephanopoulos over at ABC, Clinton's BFF, and the liberals on 'The View,' and Stephen Colbert, and fake Jake over at the CNN fake news, Rachel Maddow, do you think they're going to ask Mr. Deep State James Comey about any of this? We're not going to hold our breath. But James Comey is welcome on this show. Our invitation continues.), Block(484724289-115,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,115,

There's virtually no accountability. He's given a mandate originally and that's by Mr. Rosenstein. But once he has that mandate, every single person who -- he, Mueller or his team, unilaterally decides, is interfering with this so-called investigation, or is obstructing it or has told him what he believes to be a lie, committed perjury, he has the authority under that general mandate, under regulation 600.04, to prosecute that crime.), Block(484724289-181,Hannity-484724289,DAVID SCHOEN, CIVIL RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY,181,
So, even if the person never committed a crime at all, simply by virtue of appointing this fellow as special counsel, he now has the unilateral authority to charge someone with a vey serious crime that had nothing to do with the underlying investigation.

And I'm going to say this also: the conflicts that mark this team are absolutely astounding. The only reason special counsel is appointed under the statute, of course, is if there's reason to believe a crime was committed.

Now I'm going to assume that's as many as five or six, that's Iran, that's North Korea, that's China, that's Russia?

 Well, got to assume that they all had it. And look, Congress has a role to play here, to try and plug this leak. And to understand. Remember, the investigation by the FBI, this is a closed case. Congress is trying to get its hands on it, it's a closed case. And yet, they still won't cough up the documents.), Block(484724289-261,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,261,
 Within hours when you see a leak after the president, Dan Bongino, talks to somebody like Vladimir Putin, we know the 125 leaks in his first 126 days.

We learned that Hillary paid for Russian lies, they funneled it through a law firm. And a foreign national used his Russian sources, the Russian government sources.

We learned a lot. How much of what I just described to you is illegal?), Block(484724289-268,Hannity-484724289,CHAFFETZ,268,
 A lot of it. And in addition to that, you have people who came before Congress, raised their right hand and lied. And one of those may have been the FBI Director Mr. Comey. When John Ratcliffe asked him very specifically when he made the decision about whether or not to prosecute and when that happened. He gave an answer that's inconsistent with the fact pattern that we now have.), Block(484724289-269,Hannity-484724289,CHAFFETZ,269,
I really do believe that the two chairman of the judiciary committees, Senators Grassley and Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the House judiciary should go to Mr. Mueller and understand who's on his team, why is it that there appears to be all sorts of conflicts of interest, and why are you outside the lines in the bounds of the jurisdiction that you were given as a special prosecutor.), Block(484724289-270,Hannity-484724289,CHAFFETZ,270,
And how come you're not looking at Hillary Clinton and the Clinton team and the DCCC and the DNC and what they're all doing. Why aren't they also looking at that? Because that's also in that special prosecutor letter.), Block(484724289-271,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,271,

 Yes, yes. But you got a Congress who's absolutely, they're a bunch of wimps, they never stand up for themselves. I issued a subpoena a year and a half ago for these documents. I'm glad Bob Goodlatte is doing it now.), Block(484724289-273,Hannity-484724289,CHAFFETZ,273,
But the moment those -- that subpoena that's issued goes past compliance, then they should hold them in contempt. But nobody seems to have the guts to do that.), Block(484724289-274,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,274,

I'm absolutely convinced. He has conflicts of interest, Sean, that haven't even come out yet that some people know about behind the scenes, Mueller, to some of the people. He is conflicted.

 Because this guy was in Putin's -- Putin had operatives in America, we know they were bribing, they were involved in distortion, money laundering, kickbacks, and racketeering. We know that Putin wanted these operatives to get a foothold in the uranium industry. We import 90 percent of our uranium, it's not like we want to give to Russia. And he's there 18 months before we approve the Uranium One deal. It never made sense, John.), Block(484724289-292,Hannity-484724289,SOLOMON,292,
 It doesn't. And if you remember a year ago when I first came on, Sean, with Sara, when we're starting to talk about this, we talked about maybe the whole Donald Trump thing was a bread crumb trail to take us away from a different story. This may be the different story that the intelligence community was trying to take us our eye off the ball on.), Block(484724289-293,Hannity-484724289,SOLOMON,293,
Here is what we know. If you were an American company and engaged in bribery and kickbacks you would be what's called the barred. You'd be prevented from doing business from the United States government, you'd be punished. It happens all the time. We see announcements every week about this.), Block(484724289-294,Hannity-484724289,SOLOMON,294,
If you're Vladimir Putin's uranium company and you're involved in kickbacks, and you are involved in bribery, and you're involved in extortion, and you're involved in money laundering, but you give $500,000 to Bill Clinton and you give several million dollars to a lobbying firm that dealing with the Clintons, you know what happens to you?

 He was. Absolutely, he was the director. And we were told by law enforcement sources and Mr. Campbell, that the senior leadership of the FBI including Director Mueller was directly aware of his revelations. We're also told by Mr. Campbell and several intelligence officials that Mr. Campbell's information made it all the way into the president's daily briefing.

 PDB. He had the PDB, yes.), Block(484724289-303,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,303,
 Yes. Let's go to this issue. We didn't know that the FBI field office in Arkansas was conducting investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Because as you follow the money, a lot of people that were involved from Canada, and elsewhere, that part of the deal, that all wanted America -- America that imports 90 percent of its uranium or thereabouts, we have a shortage of it. We didn't want it in hands of a foreign actor, Russia of all places, the hostilely regime, it is in Putin the hostile actor that he is.), Block(484724289-304,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,304,
And in fact, as it was first reported by Peter Schweitzer, about 145 million over time kickback before and after to the Clinton Foundation.), Block(484724289-305,Hannity-484724289,SOLOMON,305,
 Yes, there's a lot of money that flowed. Remember Bill Clinton got a $500,000 contribution. We reported that the Russians told Doug Campbell, and he confirmed this in the interview, that they routed $3 million to an American lobbying company with the intention that the money would go to support and provide free services to Bill Clinton's charitable initiative called the Clinton global initiative.), Block(484724289-306,Hannity-484724289,SOLOMON,306,
Now it isn't just that the Russian set it. We found the money. We actually found an announcement by the Clinton global initiative and by the lobbying firm admitting that they were increasing their giving for this. So there is a path of money that goes from Russia into the Clinton's backyard. And yet, we're talking about a lot of other things today and not this.), Block(484724289-307,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,307,
 Unbelievable. All right. You spent a lot of time with him, he's had this information. But for the longest time, the government kept him under wraps.), Block(484724289-308,Hannity-484724289,SOLOMON,308,
 Yes.), Block(484724289-309,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,309,
 Because they had, you know, all this talk about nondisclosure agreements in terms of whatever happens. But the government doesn't usually do that. But they have a gag order on him and how did they get lifted.), Block(484724289-310,Hannity-484724289,SOLOMON,310,
 Yes. His attorney, Victoria Toensing, went to the Justice Department and negotiated a deal to let him talk to Congress. And then because he's talked to Congress and his story has gotten out, we've been able to interview him.), Block(484724289-311,Hannity-484724289,SOLOMON,311,
And I'll tell you something that's really important. I have a large portion of the FBI's counter intelligence file that actually shows what Doug Campbell did. His story and those facts do not match what Rod Rosenstein's prosecutors told Congress just a few months ago. They're not -- they still don't have his story right.), Block(484724289-312,Hannity-484724289,SOLOMON,312,
The facts are in these files. Congress could have access to them. Somebody should take a look because we're talking about being tough on Russia. Seven years ago we gave the boat away on uranium, and we did it while knowing that the Russians were engaged in criminal activity on our soil, compromising our national security. That's what Doug Campbell's story is all about.), Block(484724289-313,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,313,
 So we know that about Russia and we also know Hillary paid for phony or a phony dossier with Russian sources by a foreign national. It seems like with no Russia collusion evidence that I've seen, maybe you've seen, John, I haven't, it seems like all fingers point back to the left and to democrats over this.), Block(484724289-314,Hannity-484724289,SOLOMON,314,
 You know, you hear Democrats in the last few weeks saying President Trump hasn't been tough enough on Russia, we got to get tougher, they're bad actors. They're done things. But on their watch with their president, President Obama, with Secretary Clinton, we gave away some of the biggest, most valuable decisions in the uranium industry ever given to Russia.), Block(484724289-315,Hannity-484724289,SOLOMON,315,
From the Cold War on we have restrictions. Barack Obama re-lifted them. George Bush suspended a thing called the nuclear cooperation agreement. Barack Obama restored it. We allowed Russia for the first time to compete for uranium fuel contracts and they got billions upon billions of dollars. And we let them have these uranium assets called Uranium One, and we did it all knowing that they were engaged in criminality.), Block(484724289-316,Hannity-484724289,HANNITY,316,
